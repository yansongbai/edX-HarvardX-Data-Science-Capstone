# edX-HarvardX-Data-Science-Capstone
Project Overview: Choose Your Own!

For this project, you will be applying machine learning techniques that go beyond standard linear regression. You will have the opportunity to use a publicly available dataset to solve the problem of your choice. You are strongly discouraged from using well-known datasets, particularly ones that have been used as examples in previous courses or are similar to them (such as the iris, titanic, mnist, or movielens datasets, among others) - this is your opportunity to branch out and explore some new data! The UCI Machine Learning Repository and Kaggle are good places to seek out a dataset. Kaggle also maintains a curated list of datasets that are cleaned and ready for machine learning analyses. Your dataset must be automatically downloaded in your code or included with your submission. 

The ability to clearly communicate the process and insights gained from an analysis is an important skill for data scientists. You will submit a report that documents your analysis and presents your findings, with supporting statistics and figures. The report must be written in English and uploaded as both a PDF document and an Rmd file. Although the exact format is up to you, the report should include the following at a minimum:

an introduction/overview/executive summary section that describes the dataset and summarizes the goal of the project and key steps that were performed;
a methods/analysis section that explains the process and techniques used, such as data cleaning, data exploration and visualization, any insights gained, and your modeling approach;
a results section that presents the modeling results and discusses the model performance; and
a conclusion section that gives a brief summary of the report, its limitations, and future work (the last two are recommended but not necessary).
Your project submission will be graded both by your peers and by a staff member. The peer grading will give you an opportunity to check out the projects done by other learners.


Choose Your Own Instructions

The submission for the choose-your-own project will be three files: a report in the form of both a PDF document and Rmd file and the R script that performs your machine learning task. You must also provide access to your dataset, either through automatic download in your script or inclusion in a GitHub repository. (Remember, you are strongly discouraged from using well-known datasets, particularly ones that have been used as examples in previous courses or are similar to them.) We recommend submitting a link to a GitHub repository with these three files and your dataset. Your grade for the project will be based on your report and your script.

Report and Script
Your report and script will be graded by your peers, based on a rubric defined by the course staff, as well as by the course staff. The staff grade will be your final grade for the project. To receive your grade, you must review and grade the reports of five of your fellow learners after submitting your own. This will give you the chance to learn from your peers.

Please pay attention to the due dates listed! The project submission is due before the end of the course to allow time for peer grading. Also note that you must grade the reports of your peers by the course close date in order to receive your grade.

Honor Code
You are welcome to discuss your project with others, but all submitted work must be your own. Your participation in this course is governed by the terms of the edX Honor Code.

Project Due Date
Submissions for the project are due one week before course close, on January 10, 2020, at 23:59 UTC. This allows time for peer grading to occur! Peer grades are due at course close, on January 17, 2020, at 23:59 UTC.
